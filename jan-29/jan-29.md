### Primitive Data types
```
- int
- float
- double
- bool
- char
```

**`Char`s are *NOT* `String`s!**

`Strings` are different from `char`s. This is because `String`s in Java are classes whereas `char`s are primitive values.

## Operators

### Dividing
Integer division is a little different depending on the numbers you're dividing
```java
15/2
7   (int)
15.0/2
7.5   (double)
1 % 2
1   (int)
1/7
0   (int)
1/7.0
0.14285714285714285   (double)
```

### `%` Modulo
Modulo operator gives us the remainder between two divided numbers.
