### Sentinels in Java:

Sentinels in Java are special values used to indicate the end of input in situations where the length of input is not known in advance. They are commonly used in conjunction with loops to terminate input taking when a specific value is encountered.

Example:

```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class SentinelExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        
        System.out.println("Enter numbers (type -1 to stop):");
        
        int sum = 0;
        int num;
        
        while ((num = scanner.nextInt()) != -1) {
            sum += num;
        }
        
        System.out.println("Sum of numbers: " + sum);
        
        scanner.close();
    }
}
```

In this example, the user can input numbers continuously until they input `-1`, which acts as the sentinel value to stop input. The program then calculates the sum of all the numbers entered.

### Accumulators in Java:

In Java, an accumulator is a variable used to accumulate or collect values during the iteration of a loop. It is commonly used to calculate totals, averages, counts, or other aggregate values.

Example:

```java
public class AccumulatorExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int[] numbers = {5, 10, 15, 20, 25};
        int sum = 0;
        
        for (int i = 0; i < numbers.length; i++) {
            sum += numbers[i];
        }
        
        System.out.println("Sum of numbers: " + sum);
    }
}
```

In this example, `sum` acts as the accumulator variable, which accumulates the sum of all the numbers in the `numbers` array.

### For Loops / Nested For Loops in Java:

For loops in Java are used to iterate over a range of values or elements in an array or collection. Nested for loops are for loops that are placed inside other for loops, allowing for more complex iteration patterns, such as iterating over two-dimensional arrays or performing nested iterations.

Example of a simple for loop:

```java
public class ForLoopExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        for (int i = 1; i <= 5; i++) {
            System.out.println("Count: " + i);
        }
    }
}
```

Example of a nested for loop:

```java
public class NestedForLoopExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        for (int i = 1; i <= 3; i++) {
            for (int j = 1; j <= 3; j++) {
                System.out.println("i: " + i + ", j: " + j);
            }
        }
    }
}
```

In the nested for loop example, the outer loop iterates three times, and for each iteration of the outer loop, the inner loop iterates three times, resulting in a total of nine iterations.
